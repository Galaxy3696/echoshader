# GSoC Contributor's Guide

The Echoshader team aims to recruit talented [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) participants to help us create the capability to interactively visualize large volumes of cloud-hosted ocean sonar data to accelerate the the data exploration and discovery process. This project will go hand-in-hand with ongoing development of the [echopype](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype) package that handles the standardization, pre-processing, and organization of these data. We aim for creating ocean sonar data visualization functionalities based on the [HoloViz](https://github.com/holoviz/holoviz) suite of tools, and developing widgets that can be flexibly combined in [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) or used in Jupyter notebooks for interactive data visuzliation.


## Getting Started

TBD




## Brainstorm with us!

In the [Issues](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echoshader/issues) section of this repository, we list some visualization ideas from mentors. We encourage you as a GSoC participant to propose your own original ideas as new issues.

Feel free to propose project ideas [raising an issue](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echoshader/issues/new/choose) in this repo.

After you [sign up as a GSoC participant](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started/), feel free to to propose project ideas and ask questions via [raising an issue](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echoshader/issues/new/choose).

Once the official application opens, please submit your proposals based on the [Echoshader GSoC Proposal](proposal-template.md) template.


### Questions?

For project-related question, feel free to [raise an issue] (https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echoshader/issues/new/choose).

## The Mentor Team
<!-- Open Source Ocean Acoustics started back in 2018 from [OceanHackWeek](https://oceanhackweek.github.io/). It is meant as a home for open source tools and resources in ocean acoustics.  -->
The GSoC 2022 mentor team consists of members (@b-reyes, @emiliom, @leewujung, @lsetiawan, @valentina-s) of the [Echospace](https://uw-echospace.github.io/) group at the University of Washington in Seattle. We are a diverse group of researchers whose work centers around extracting knowledge from large volumes of ocean acoustic data, which contain rich information about animals ranging from zooplankton, fish, to marine mammals. Integrating physics-based models and data-driven methods, our current work focuses on mining water column sonar data and spans a broad spectrum from developing computational methods, building open source software and cloud applications, to joint analysis of acoustic observations and ocean environmental variables.
