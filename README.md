Core ocean sonar data visualization functionalities based on the [HoloViz](https://holoviz.org/) suite of Python tools.

## What are ocean sonar systems?

Ocean sonar systems, such as echosounders, are the [workhorse to study life in the ocean](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/e245977def474bdba60952f30576908f). They provide continuous observations of fish and zooplankton by transmitting sounds and analyzing the echoes bounced off these animals, just like how medical ultrasound images the interior of human body. In recent years these systems are widely deployed on ships, autonomous vehicles, or moorings, bringing in a lot of data that allow scientists to study the change of the marine ecosystem.

## Google Summer of Code

Hey there! Welcome! ðŸ˜ƒ

This project aims to enhance the capability to interactively visualize large volumes of cloud-based ocean sonar data to accelerate the data exploration and discovery process. The project will go hand-in-hand with ongoing development of the [echopype](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype) package that handles the standardization, pre-processing, and organization of these data.

For more information about joining the project as a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) contributor, check out the [GSoC Contributor's Guide](gsoc_contributors_guide.md).
